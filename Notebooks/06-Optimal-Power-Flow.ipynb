    "## Optimal Power Flow\n",
    "**Power Systems Optimization**\n",
    "\n",
    "by Michael R. Davidson, Jesse D. Jenkins and Sambuddha Chakrabarti (last updated: October 6, 2020)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an introduction to the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem in electric power systems&mdash;which minimizes the short-run production costs of meeting electricity demand at a number of connected locations from a given set of generators subject to various technical and transmission network flow limit constraints. This will be our first treatment of a *network*, which is critical to all power systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first introduce a model of transmission flows that assumes we can control the flow along each path, in what is called a \"**transport model**.\" This is a straightforward extension to [Economic Dispatch](04-Economic-Dispatch.ipynb) (ED), where we have multiple supply and demand balance constraints, and a new set of flow constraints. This is also similar to other common optimization problems such as fleet routing of shipments.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then introduce a linear approximation to the optimal power flow problem known as \"**DC-OPF**\", where we begin to incorporate some of the physics involved in how electricity flows along transmission lines. With this formulation, we recognize that given \"injections\" (i.e., generation) and \"withdrawals\" (i.e., demand) of power at each node in the network, flows along lines are not independently controllable. Instead, electrical power flows across transmission lines in relation to their physical properties, namely power flows across parallel circuits or paths in inverse proportion to the [electrical impedance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance) of the lines. This can (very frequently) result in hitting flow constraints before we would if could control power flows across all lines as in the transport problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model does not explore the full functionality of DC-OPF, which can include inter-temporal constraints, additional generation constraints (e.g., on voltage), security constraints to ensure stability in the case of contingencies, and network losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Full \"AC optimal power flow\" models are also beyond the scope of this notebook, as the full set of physics associated with the interactions of AC flows introduces non-convexities that make this problem much harder to solve. Due to the non-convex nature of the AC power flow problem, simplified formulations that linearize and approximate these complex constraints are frequently employed in power systems operations, including by electricity system operators, which use a linearized \"security-constrained\" optimal power flow (which ensures power flows would remain simulatenously feasible across a range of possible contingencies) to clear real-time electricity markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start off with some simple systems, whose solutions can be worked out manually without resorting to any mathematical optimization model and software. But, eventually we will be solving larger system, thereby emphasizing the importance of such software and mathematical models."

    "## Introduction to OPF\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem is a power system optimal scheduling problem which captures the physics of electricity flows, adding a layer of complexity and more realism to the Economic Dispatch (ED) problem. OPF usually attempts to capture the entire network topology by representing the transmission line interconnections between different nodes (also known as buses, or locations where generators or demand inject or withdraw power into/from the network) including various electrical parameters, such as resistance, series reactance, shunt admittance, etc. The full alternating current or \"AC\" OPF turns out to be an extremely hard problem to solve (usually NP-hard). Hence, system operators and power marketers usually go about solving a linearized version of it, called the \"DC-OPF.\" The DC-OPF approximation works satisfactorily for bulk power transmission networks as long as such networks are not operated at the brink of instability or under heavily loaded conditions."

    "\n",
    "The above model is not physically correct as we cannot arbitrarily route power through lines. We will now introduce a linear approximation to the optimal power flow problem that incorporates this limitation and is tractable and reasonably accurate. This is commonly called the \"DC\" optimal power flow problem, but in reality (as we'll see below), it is a linearization that still relates to the physics of AC power flows, it just simplifies (and ignores) certain non-convexities to produce a tractable linear programming problem that remains a valid approximation under certain circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the \"DC\" or linear approximation of the AC optimal power flow problem, power flows along a line from bus $i$ to bus $j$ are driven by voltage [phase angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phasor) differences, denoted by $\\theta_i$ and $\\theta_j$:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $B_{ij}$ is the [susceptance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptance) for the line connecting buses $i$ and $j$. Susceptance is the imaginary part of the [admittance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admittance) of a line, where [admittance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admittance) is a complex number that describes how easy it is for AC current to flow across a given conductor. Power flows in parallel circuits in an AC network in proportion to their admittance (or inverse proportion to [impedance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance), which describes how hard it is a measure of the opposition that a circuit presents to a current when a voltage is applied).\n",
    "\n",
    "Voltage [phase](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/alternating-current/chpt-1/ac-phase/) angles describe the displacement of the AC voltage waveform at each node, relative to a reference bus. A difference in voltage angles between buses $i$ and $j$ indicates that the peaks and troughs in the sinusoidal voltage waveform at bus $i$ is shifted in time relative to the voltage waveform at bus $j$, as in the image below.\n",

    "\n",
    "What causes the shift in voltage phase angle? An AC current flowing across a conductor encountering either [inductive reactance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance#Inductive_reactance) (which relates to the quantity of energy required to continually induce or establish magnetic fields around a conductor as AC current polarity flips each cycle) or [capacitive reactance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance#Capacitive_reactance) (which relates to the quantity of energy required to sustain capacitive charges between two conductors separated by an insulator) will experience a shift in the voltage waveform, relative to the current wave form. Inductive reactance causes the voltage waveform to shift forward relative to the current, while capacitive reactive cases the voltage to shift backwards relative to the current. In transmission lines, the primary source of voltage phase angle shifts is the inductance of the transmission lines themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason this approximation is known as the \"DC OPF\" is because we ignore reactive power flows and focus only on flows of real power as in a DC network. But you can see why \"DC\" OPF is actually a misnomer: we're still dealing with AC voltages and susceptance terms here, we're just linearizing the problem through some simplifying assumptions. In particular, the three basic assumptions used to derive a linearized or OPF approximation from the underlying AC OPF problem are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The resistance for each branch is negligible relative to the reactance, and can therefore be approximated as ~0.\n",
    "2. The voltage magnitude at each bus is equal to the base voltage.\n",
    "3. The voltage angle difference $(\\theta_j-\\theta_i)$ across any branch from bus $i$ to $j$ is sufficiently small such that $cos(\\theta_j-\\theta_i) \\approx 1$ and $sin(\\theta_j-\\theta_i) \\approx (\\theta_j-\\theta_i)$\n",

We must increase from Gen B, but in doing so, part of the power from Gen B will go through $l_{2,1} \\rightarrow l_{1,3}$ in addition to $l_{2,3}$, since power flows split across parallel paths in proportion to admittance (or inverse proportion to impedance). However, without adjusting Gen A's output, an increase in production from Gen B will cause us to exceed the transmission constraint on line $l_{1,3}$, requiring us to throttle back power from Gen A to keep power flows feasible.\n",
